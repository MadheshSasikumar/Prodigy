# Task 5

# Introduction
This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. 
The goal is to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors, providing insights into potential areas for safety improvements.

# Dataset
The analysis is based on the Road Traffic Accidents dataset, which contains information on various accidents, including details about the date, time, location, weather conditions, and road conditions at the time of the accident.

# Objectives

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Standardize and normalize data where necessary.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distribution of accidents based on time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions.
Explore correlations between different variables, such as weather and road conditions.


Visualization:

Create visual representations of accident hotspots using geographic data.
Visualize patterns and trends in accidents related to time of day, weather, and road conditions.


Insights:

Summarize key findings from the analysis.
Discuss potential recommendations for improving road safety.

# Results
The results of the analysis will be available in the form of visualizations and summary statistics. Key insights will be discussed, focusing on accident hotspots and factors contributing to accidents.
