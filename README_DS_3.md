# Task 3

# Introduction
This project involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. 
The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Dataset
The Bank Marketing dataset contains information about direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
 The dataset includes various attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, and more, along with the target variable indicating whether the client subscribed to a term deposit.

# Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values


Encoding categorical variables


Feature scaling


Splitting the data into training and testing sets



# Model Building
The decision tree classifier is built using the Scikit-learn library.


Initializing the decision tree classifier


Training the model on the training dataset


Evaluating the model on the test dataset

# Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
These metrics help assess how well the model predicts whether a customer will purchase a product or service.

# Results
The results section provides insights into the model's performance, including a confusion matrix and a detailed report of the evaluation metrics. 
Further analysis on feature importance can also be included.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchases based on demographic and behavioral data. 
The Bank Marketing dataset provides a rich set of features to work with, and the decision tree model offers interpretability in understanding how different attributes influence the prediction.
