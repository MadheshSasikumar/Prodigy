# Task 4
# Introduction
This project aims to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. 
We will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze the data, and data visualization tools to present the findings.


# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle: Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis              
It includes tweets related to various entities (brands, topics, etc.) along with their sentiment scores (positive, negative, or neutral).


# Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data.


Sentiment Analysis: Run the sentiment analysis model to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories.


Data Visualization: Use visualization tools to display the results, including sentiment trends over time, most discussed entities, etc.



# Results
The results of the analysis, including graphs and charts, are stored in the results/ directory. 
The findings provide insights into public sentiment towards specific topics or brands over time.


# Conclusion:
Overall, this project demonstrates the power of NLP and data visualization in extracting meaningful insights from social media data. 
It serves as a foundation for further analysis and exploration, offering a roadmap for understanding public sentiment and its implications for various industries.
