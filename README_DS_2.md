# Task 2

# Introduction
This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. 
The goal is to explore the relationships between variables, identify patterns and trends in the data, and provide insights into the factors that might have influenced survival rates on the Titanic.

# Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers who were aboard the Titanic, including their age, gender, class, and whether they survived the disaster. 
Dataset: https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/blob/master/titanic.csv

# Project Structure

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing irrelevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and analyzing the data to uncover patterns and relationships.
Conclusion: Summarizing findings and insights gained from the analysis.



Data Cleaning: Handling missing values



Handle Missing Values: Identify and fill or drop missing values in the dataset.



Correct Data Types: Ensure that the data types of each column are appropriate for analysis.



Remove Irrelevant Features: Drop columns that do not provide useful information for the analysis.



# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize Data: Use various visualization techniques to understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between different features.



Analyze Relationships: Explore the relationships between different variables, such as the relationship between age and survival, gender and survival, class and survival, etc.



Identify Patterns and Trends: Look for any patterns or trends in the data that might provide insights into the factors that influenced survival rates on the Titanic.



# Conclusion
The conclusion section summarizes the key findings and insights from the EDA.
 It highlights the most significant factors that influenced survival rates and provides recommendations for further analysis or actions based on the findings.
