# TASK 1



# Introduction
This project aims to create a visualization of the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
 By analyzing these distributions, we can gain insights into demographic trends and characteristics within a specific dataset.



# Overview
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to create a bar chart or histogram using a real-world dataset. 
We will use Python and libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to generate the visualizations. This project is intended for data enthusiasts and beginners who want to learn about data visualization techniques.



# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the World Bank and contains information on population statistics. 
We will use the dataset available at the following link: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL



# Data Preparation
Before visualizing the data, we will perform some data preprocessing steps, including:

Cleaning the data
Handling missing values
Categorizing



# Visualization
The project includes the following visualizations:

Bar Chart: To represent categorical data, such as gender distribution.



Histogram: To represent continuous data, such as the distribution of ages.



We will use Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.




# Conclusion
This project showcases the process of visualizing population data to understand demographic trends. 
The visualizations provide a clear and concise way to communicate insights derived from the data. This project can be extended by including more advanced analyses or visualizations.
